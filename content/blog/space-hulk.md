After their last mission, the Emir mentioned two things:

- Sakir Mudhi, the Foundation handler, was looking for them
- The Emir has a research station on Arara—a small, hot planet in the Dabaran system—that hasn’t reported back in two weeks and knew the team was capable of solving tough problems

The team set out to talk with Sakir. When they arrived, without looking up from his book, Sakir mentioned he heard that the party had found something quite unique down in the Wound. The team was a bit cagey about it, but Sakir said he was just trying to help. He told them team about an antiquities dealer who might be able to help unlock the potential of their kinetic intelligence. His name is Cyril Rahal and he’s located on the Hormous Spaceport over in the Melik system. Sakir admitted to getting a finder’s fee, but only minimally so, the intellectual curiosity is more important to him.

After weighing going to see Cyril and going to Arara, the party decided to make their way to Arara. They launched the Narzalus into space and pointed it toward Arara.

After an uneventful days length of travel, the peace was interrupted by the sound of metal scraping against metal as the Narzalus scraped up against another ship. The team took a close look at the ship and found it nearly devoid of life and peppered with punctures the size of beach balls.

Nima and Dr. Wana made their way to the bridge, occasionally ducking the body of a dead crew member here and there. They found it, but couldn’t get the power on quickly, so they kept working at it.

Meanwhile, Odella, Zebo, and Rouya made their way to the cargo bay. Zebo took note of a machine shop and picked out some spare parts (10) to take back to the ship. After taking those, the group made their way through the cargo bay, taking note of all of the containers full of ore. Then they noticed a gap in the line of cargo containers and took a look down the corridor. They saw a smaller palette covered in white shrink wrapped bricks with a puddle of darkness eating at the bottom of it. Odella remembered what they were right away: Jayrats, a darkmorph and manifestation of the Darkness Between the Stars and only fire would destroy them.

Rouya, upfront, was plunged into sudden darkness as the Jayrats seemed to enlarge their darkness to cover her.

Odella decided to get out, but not before grabbing a brick or two of whatever the Jayrats were nibbling at. He jumped over and kicked off of the ore container just barely escaping past a nebulous black claw that stretched out from the swarm of Jayrats.

Rouya took a few steps back, and then Zebo pushed a container over, blocking the Jayrats from pursuing the group, but not before a claw rose up and slashed at his shoulder.

Meanwhile Dr. Wana and Nima were making their way to the cargo bay since Nima was the only one with explosives (or fire of any kind).

The Jayrats attempted to push back on the overturned container of ore and managed to shift it slightly, but it mostly remained in place.

Rouya pushed back and the cargo container started moving back toward the odd palette. The Nima arrived and planted the explosives and the team made for a hasty retreat. The Jayrats took one last attempt at pushing back and couldn’t move the container.

Back aboard the ship, Nima dashed for the bridge and the rest of the crew clambered aboard, helping Nima begin undocking from the hulk. They quickly made their way from the ship and triggered the explosives with some ore shooting out of the cargo bay doors and fire coming up on the visual scanners from the explosive.

With a bit less stress, Odella noticed the two containers he picked up were two bricks of Kambra, a drug known for states of euphoria, but a bad day of hangover afterwards. Each brick contains 25 does (50 doses total). Kambra adds +1 to **Manipulation** for a few hours, followed by a bad day of hangover. Suffer 2 mind points of stress per use.
