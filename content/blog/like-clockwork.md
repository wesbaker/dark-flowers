- Crew went down into the excavation site and went to the room with the stone bier
  - A Byara, clinging to the ceiling attacks Odella with a talon to the eye, gouging the eye
  - The crew manages to handily take down the Byara, but not before it bit Rouya and clung onto her arm
  - Rouya’s arm starts to feel tingly as it loses feeling from the bite and the Byara’s saliva
- Poras takes Dr. Wana’s MedKit and heals both Rouya and patches up Odella’s eye (though still impacted by the attack)
- The ship sends an alarm that another ship has landed and the robot relays that this is a friendly human
- The crew goes up and finds Zitane Ben walking down the hallway
  - Zitane is looking loaded for bear
  - Zitane asks the crew what they’re doing here and asks them if they’ve not questioned Emir Rahibe III’s intentions before and asks if the crew knows about Nazareem’s Sacrifice and their goals.
  - Suspects this site is part of Nazareem’s Sacrifice and that Emir Rahibe III is helping to rebuild them.
- The crew goes down the excavation site and follows the cables to find the Cadaver Clock, a wooden framed mash up of gears and wheels with dead bodies on it. Cables run from it to another stone bier next to it, with various other cables running to other small rooms, like the one the crew went in before.
- An ethereal creature who introduces itself as Taba appears out of the ground and asks the crew what their intentions are, why they’re here.
  - Dr. Wana plays it cool :snowflake: and says they’re here to offer a blood sacrifice.
  - Taba is intrigued and focuses on Dr. Wana, instilling in her the feeling that Rouya is slandering her behind her back
  - The crew plots and plans how to deal with this creature, Zitane passes along that it’s ethereal and until it takes physical form, it can’t be hurt. The crew asks Zitane to take a shot if he can.
  - Poras finds a spare grenade on the ground and starts to sneak behind Taba, intending to blow up the Cadaver Clock, he plants it and
  - Dr. Wana plots with Rouya about faking an attack, and starts approaching Rouya, at this point Taba spurs on Dr. Wana, but Dr. Wana shakes it off at the last moment and remembers that this isn’t true, but she fakes a strike anyways.
  - Poras’s grenade explodes, but leaves the Cadaver Clock intact
  - Taba takes physical form
  - Zitane lines up his shot and manages to take out the creatures legs from under it, greatly harming it
  - Rouya finishes the job
- Catching themselves after taking Taba down, the crew gets an alert from the ship: 6 unfriendly humans have entered the hangar bay.
