You started in the engineering section (or just outside it in the main corridor)

- You went to the Med Lab
- There you found the stasis beds and Dr. Siyab Dahiljaba (one of the crew of the Shamza)
- You took Dr. Dahiljaba to your ship (Narzalus) and came back to the space station, he went willingly and was likely still in shock
- You went to the Laboratory Section and took note of all of the specimen capsules
- Nima Dol-Soufi managed to use the terminals to retrieve the entire database (noting that there was only one marked as a success and many others that were marked as failure) and found a message that implied Wahina was doing something not quite right
- You (Rouya?) saw a humanoid covered in the black biomatter, roots, vines, and leaves and they ran off down the corridor
- You left the Laboratory Section and Samioh Amin was grabbed and held at gunpoint by Amirah (one of the crew of the Shamza) and she explained that she needed your help to blow up the space station and get away, she believes the biomatter and the experiments done here to be heresy and an abomination to the Icons. Through some discussion and ultimately one heck of a tackle by Rouya, you took her down and restrained her (putting her on your ship, I think?).
- The team headed to the Biodome where they found Wahina along with the other former crew members who had all been experimented on with the only plant sample marked as a success, but the three former crew members were no longer human, much more plant. Wahina on the other hand has retained much of her humanity, other than being an inhuman color. Wahina explained that she did this to help her people and that her ultimate goal is to go back to Yehenna and administer the serum to the entire population to help them flourish and survive in the desert, though she’s not 100% certain she’s ready yet, but she believes she must act.
