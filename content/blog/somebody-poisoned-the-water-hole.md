**Note: the water hole is not poisoned.**

This was the most combat-heavy session so far.

- The operative approached the door and started filling the room with gas.
- The team had a hard time the operative that Dr. Wana saw the bootprints for, but eventually Rouya grappled them and shoved them into the room which was now filled with gas and removed their helmet, causing them to be knocked out. Rouya noted that this person looked to be a Legionnaire.
- Listening to the comms unit the operative was wearing, they started hearing other people checking in and concerned that there was no response, they noted they were coming too. It sounded like most of the voices were from Legionnaires, though one voice was clearly not and more zealous about killing the party.
- No one saw the additional operatives until they opened the door and displaced the rather foggy gas, then both Tudi and Zebo saw the three operatives.
- The Robot saw them and operating per its protocols, grappled one of the new operatives.
- One of the operatives took a shot at Zebo and retreated while the other retreated and setup an overwatch.
- Rouya took a shot at the one pointed at the door and managed to force them to drop their weapon (stopping their overwatch).
- Dr. Wana attempted to move to cover to shoot at one of the operatives, but was shot on her way over by a cloaked operative, taking a lot of damage.
- Tudi Izo ran over to the grappled operative and removed his helmet, causing him to pass out from the gas. He then ran back to his position by the door.
- Zebo charged and dove over the box the operative was using for cover and used the combination of his own strength and that of this exo to grapple one of the operatives.
- The robot continued its patrol.
- The grappled operative attempted to escape the grapple, but couldnâ€™t.
- The operative who dropped his gun, picked it up and moved behind cover, and shot at Rouya (Note: I think this is what I did and if so, I used too many action points: move = 1AP, pick up weapon = 1AP, shoot = 2AP, if so I can deduct a DP)
- The last operative took a shot at Dr. Wana, but she danced out of the way.
