- You went to the Emir of Yehenna (Emir Rahibe III) with the research and sample
- You met with Emir Rahibe III and his Vizier, Daya
- You were rewarded with a Grav Craft that can fly 500ft above both land and water
- While the Vizier went to arrange the Grav Craft, the Emir tasked you with a mission he clearly wanted hidden from the Vizier: he wants you to go to a Foundation dig site near the Wound, go down into one of the caves they were excavating, and find a tome. This tome is likely locked and possibly hidden from view. The dig site is guarded by Legionnaires that have been instructed that lethal force is authorized to keep people out.
- When the Vizier came back, the Emir quickly sat back and stopped talking about this mission and the Vizier then ushered you outside to see your new Grav Craft, the Emir remained inside.
- While playing with the new Grav Craft, Dr. Wana noticed someone who didn’t quite fit in at the mouth of an alley, they then slunk back into the shadows slowly.
- Dr. Wana and Nima approached this person who turned out to be Zitane Ben, an agent with Parr-Nestera. He asked about your mission and Dr. Wana tried to be secretive but then explained their task honestly and Zitane made a request: if you bring him whatever you find first so he can look at it he’s been authorized to forgive a year’s payment on your ship (37,500 birr). He doesn’t want to keep whatever you find as he doesn’t want to raise suspicion, he simply wants a look. Zitane has been attempting to figure out what the Emir is up to and has a hunch that it’s not good.
- You took the Grav Craft back to your ship and talked over your approach and what your next steps are.
