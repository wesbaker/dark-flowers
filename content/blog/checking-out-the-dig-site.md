- You went to the dig site around dusk, you saw some of the foundation archaeologists leaving the site
- You saw four legionnaires at the site and determined that three were average grunts and one was the leader of some sort
- Dr. Wana approached the leader, who turned out to be Mirah Naser and attempted to get her to let you into the site, she then called her Lieutenant in the Legion and they had nothing on the books about anyone supposed to be at the dig site at that time
- Dr. Wana mentioned that they’re on secret company business for Parr-Nestera and Mirah was not buying it, but she received a phone call from Zitane Ben, he told her to let you through, or so you gathered from the other end of the conversation. She said she wanted nothing to do with Zitane and threatened to hunt you down and kill you if anything bad comes out of this, but she permitted you to search the site.
- You went down the elevator and sent Rouya into the first cave, which turned out to be empty except for a cutting torch.
- You went to the next cave over, and much like the first it was a rough hewn, rocky surface near the opening, but as you went further in, the walls, floor, and ceiling were smooth and perfectly level. In the middle of the room was a cylindrical block of metal about 8’ tall. Upon further observation Zebo saw seams and joints, but so perfectly created that it’s not human-built. Dr. Wana used her encyclopedic knowledge of the Portal Builder technology to recall that this is a Kinetic Intelligence, a machine of Portal Builder origin that can be used for many tasks, but typically mining and security.
- Between Zebo’s technological smarts and Dr. Wana’s Portal Builder technology you managed to find the battery compartment and open it up. The battery doesn’t look like anything you have, but Zebo jury-rigged a way to transfer the energy from the cutting torch’s cell to the Kinetic Intelligence’s cell.
- Zebo and Nima hung behind the Kinetic Intelligence and popped the battery in while Rouya, Samioh, and Dr. Wana waited by the opening of the cave.
- Once the battery was in, the Kinetic Intelligence came alive, a carbine sliding out of it’s right arm/appendage.
- Nima used his hacking/Data Djinn to get the robot to retract that weapon, but then a separate weapon, a glowing blade of some sort slid out of it’s left arm/appendage and it attacked Zebo, narrowly missing the shipworker.
- Zebo attempted to grapple the Kinetic Intelligence, but it managed to avoid the grapple.
- Dr. Wana came further into the cave and protected Nima with her shield while he worked on the Kinetic Intelligence. Nima quickly scanned Dr. Wana’s database for information on how to stop the robot, but that took some time.
- The Kinetic Intelligence then grabbed Zebo in a bear hug grapple and started to squeeze him.
- With things getting dangerous Nima attempted to hack the Kinetic Intelligence once again and with only limited success, he prayed to The Messenger who saw fit to assist Nima in this pursuit, and he managed to get through to it. It then released Zebo, scanned the room again, and turned to face Nima and simply waited.
