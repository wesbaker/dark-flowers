Continuing the fight from [last session...](/somebody-poisoned-the-water-hole)

- Rouya continued the fight and saw success most of the fight, she managed to shoot “The Red Dude” (who later turned out to be a Zenithian Hegemony agent named Cemal), severely wounding him and causing stress as well
- Tudi vaulted over the crates and attempted to punch Cemal, but ended up hitting him square in the helmet.
- Dr. Wana took a quick shot at one of the soldiers (who turned out to be hired Legionnaires) and missed.
- Zebo, still grappling one of the Legionnaires, punched him, causing a little damage while maintaining the grapple and keeping the soldier out of the fight..
- Rouya took aim at one of the Legionnaires and managed to both wound him and cause an injury when a bullet fragment ricocheted into the soldier’s wrist, causing him to drop his weapon.
- Onboard the Narzalus, Samioh attempted to scan for the ship everyone knew to be there, but they still couldn’t pick it up on the scanners.
- Also onboard the Narzalus, Nima attempted a blind shot at the cloaked ship and missed, hitting the sand which rained on top of the enemy vessel and gave a hint of it’s size: smaller than the Narzalus, but bigger than their skiff.
- The grappled Legionnaire attempted to wrest free of Zebo’s grapple, but only equaled his strength.
- The other Legionnaire, wounded by Rouya, took it personally and shot her, with only a minor flesh wound to show for it.
- “The Red Dude” threw down his weapon and screamed, asking why are they even fighting? Why is the party even involved? In talking, the party admitted their employment by the Emir, which made the agent—Cemal—livid. He explained he was an agent of the Zenithian Hegemony and it was his mission to hurt and/or destabilize any Firstcome and, more specifically, any city state on Dabaran. The Legionnaires with him were under his employ and simply paid mercenaries.
- The party talked Cemal into surrendering and getting the Legionnaires to lay down their weapons. The Legionnaires were stuffed into their stasis beds on the cloaked ship and Cemal was taken onboard the Narzalus.
- The party delivered Cemal to the Emir and were rewarded for thwarting him and saw the guards take him away to the Emir’s dungeons. The Emir offhand mentioned that Sakir Mudhi (their Foundation contact) was looking for them.
- The party then contacted the cloaked ship’s owners (the Zenithian Hegemony) and asked about making a deal for the ship and soldiers. The person on the other end wanted to know why their ship had been confiscated and why this group was attempting to negotiate with them after stopping their agent and not even handing him back, but through some careful manipulation and prayer, Samioh managed to trade the ship and soldiers back for the soldier’s stealth suits.
- When the party asked the Zenithian Hegemonist about future work, the person mentioned they only want one thing: the death of the Firstcome.
