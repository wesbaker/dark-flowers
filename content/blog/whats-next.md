- Finished talking with Zitane, showed him the book, he had the key to open it and perused it in front of you
- Zitane is worried about what the Emir is doing, but not 100% on what the Emir is up to, but it is dangerous from what he can see, Zitane wants you to continue operating as normal
- Zitane walks back into the forest and your grav craft continued working and you headed back to the ship
- In the morning you go to the Emir and give him the book, he pays the promised, 20,000 birr to the entire group (everyone gets 3,333 birr)
- The Emir tells you about troubles he’s having with one of his oases having the accumulated water stolen from it on a weekly basis (last stolen two days ago). The criminals have never been seen and never hurt anyone, but they do take the water. The Emir’s greenhouse plantations have enough water in reserve to survive for 2 or 3 more weeks.
- You then go to a local watering hole, the Purple Xylophone, and talk with the bartender Ziri about the area and what there is to do, and you notice someone looking at you who waves you over
- Ayham Subedar offers you a job to find an asteroid and mine it. Will let you keep the ore they don’t need and offers 15,000 birr. Will install a drill for you, but wants it back after the job.
