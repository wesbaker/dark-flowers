- Team went to the pumping station at the oasis
- Team talked to the guards at the station, the guards are always sleeping when this happens and don’t have any memories of anything happening
- Team surveyed the pumping station and saw the pumps, tanks, guard station, and bunks
- Team looked through video logs and saw two things: 1) the interior filling with fog with the guards laying prone after the fog cleared (after considerable time) and no heat signatures other than the guards and 2) the exterior view had a black sky
- Dr. Wana collected some samples of the residue the drug left and learned it was Sarinade, a inexpensive and uncommon gas typically used for medical procedures, the only known side-effect is amnesia and only when used in large dosages
- Zebo and Tudi used their environment sensors and learned the gas comes in through the front door of the pumping house
- The team decided to hunker down and wait until night to see if the thieves showed up again (Nima and Samioh are in the Narzalus; Rouya buried herself in the sand; Dr. Wana is pretending to be a plastic barrel; Zebo, Tudi, and Robot are inside the pumping house, with the humans wearing exo suits)
- Samioh sensors started going off, but when he did a scan, nothing came up. He didn’t quite believe it and looked harder, but still: nothing.
- Rouya and Dr. Wana noticed some odd winds that were causing the sand near the building to whir and fly in a circular pattern, consistent with a ship, but noticed nothing
- Dr. Wana then heard the quiet footsteps and saw a very shallow bootprint as something passed in front of her
