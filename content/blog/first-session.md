- You spacewalked over to the station
- You saw black biomatter on the outside and inside of the space station
- The reactor core still has power, but the station was powered down
- You found a helmet with some of the biomatter on the inside
- The space station has oxygen and gravity
- You went onboard the Shamza (the other ship) and found no signs of life, but the ship seems to be intact and operational
- You turned on the lighting in Engineering
- Zebaraimas “Zebo” Hutul learned that he can overload the reactor to cause a meltdown
- Zebaraimas “Zebo” Hutul had a feeling that something was observing him, but when he turned around, nothing was there
- The black biomatter has small purple flowers growing on it
- Zebaraimas “Zebo” Hutul took off his helmet briefly inside the ship to take his drugs and noticed that it stank
