You started on the space station

- You gathered the research and some samples of the flowers/biomatter
- You flew your ship and the Shamza to Dabaran and landed at the Foundation outpost between Lotus (holy city) and the Wound
- You explained what you found (10,000 birr), gave back the Shamza, Professor Siyab, and Amirah (10,000 birr), and also sold them the research and the sample (negotiating another 10,000 birr)
