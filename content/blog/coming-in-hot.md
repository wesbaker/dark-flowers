- Crew arrived at Research Station Hadia, had a hot arrival into the bay, no damage to ship
- Saw the double door entrance into the station, the words “No Escape” written on the doors in blood
- Another ship was in the bay, sabotaged, but otherwise in okay condition, much smaller than the Narzalus
- Crew entered the station and took a right, walking to the Chief Researcher’s office
  - Found someone they didn’t know rifling through the papers in the office
  - Found papers mentioning something “beautiful, something from our ancestors. It holds power beyond our imagination.”
  - Looked on the cameras and saw people milling about the Medicurg Dome, flocked to the sound of someone’s voice coming from the speaker, but otherwise just ambling about
  - Saw an empty mess hall
  - Saw an excavation site entrance and ladder down
- Went to the supply locker, popped the lock, and found some weapons, armor, and a probe drone
- Went to the excavation site entrance and sent the probe drone down
  - Saw a cable and went to the right and found a stone bier with a concave indentation with the cable coming up to it, threading on the end of the cable
  - Went the other direction with the drone, the probe shut down
- Crew went down into the excavation site and went to the room with the stone bier
  - They were then attacked by a Byara
