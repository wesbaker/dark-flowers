- You poured some of Samioh’s wine in the bowl and nothing happened, you then lit the wine on fire, nothing happened
- Dr. Wana went and looked at the glyphs at the base of the statues and learned that this was definitely a portal builder site
- Two of you (I forget who) took a closer look at the statues and realized that the arms moved on the statues
- Rouya pulled the arm on the statue with the amphora and it started dispensing water, you took a handful to the pedestal and nothing happened
- Tudi pulled the arm of the statue with the cupped hands and it started dispensing sand (and was stuck on, starting a timer), you tried taking over a handful of sand, nothing happened
- Tudi pulled the arm of the statue with the ceremonial rod and was struck with 3 points of lightning damage in his chest
- Nima started using his canteen to pull water from the amphora and put it in the bowl, others began to help. As more and more water was added, you heard a rumbling nearby. As the bowl was filled, the wall behind the bowl slid up, revealing three alcoves.
- The first alcove you went to had a smooth gray tablet, Dr. Wana used her research library and found out it was an Exophasic Generator, which allows you to go to another universe and appear back in this one, basically moving undetected as long as you can remember how to get there (since you are in the other universe)
- Then there was the staff, as people with a high enough empathy (3) picked that up, they were shocked and then passed out, when they woke up they could sense something new about themselves, they could feel power around them (+2 Mystic Powers, -1 to an Advanced Skill)
- Then you picked up the locked book (that the Emir asked for) and it was inert
- You took the elevator back up and Mirah Naser (the Legionnaire) asked you to leave as quickly as possible, but Samioh asked what her deal with Zitane is. You learned that Zitane could have her lose her job or have her killed if she divulged too much about Zitane, but she confirmed Zitane works for Parr-Nestera, but that you won’t find him on any employee list.
- You got on your gravcraft and started heading back to the ship, but the gravcraft stopped working somewhere in the forest.
- Then Zitane walked out very close to where your gravcraft now lay disabled.
